# services (placeholders)

This starter keeps most logic in the MCP server for simplicity.

In a production deployment, you will typically separate:
- ingestion (partner feeds/APIs)
- recommender (embeddings + ranking)
- try-on (async image pipeline)
- commerce (approval, partner checkout, order tracking)
- fullbody-validator (strict photo quality and framing validation)

These folders are **placeholders** for that split.
