# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: implement
- **Task**: 1.6 POC checkpoint (manual end-to-end on macOS)
- **Status**: in progress

## Original goal

Omnichannel fashion assistant with enforced full-body photos and iMessage bridge

## Completed

- Implemented `apps/imsg-bridge` workspace (macOS iMessage bridge daemon)
- Added `POST /channels/imessage/upload` for bridge attachment uploads
- Enforced `photoUrls` requirement for strict full-body validation + try-on
- Fixed WhatsApp/Telegram sender unit tests and stabilized test runner
- Root test suite now includes `apps/imsg-bridge`

## Learnings

- iMessage transport must be a separate macOS component; AWS can only host the backend.
- Base64 uploads require a larger JSON body limit; production should move to S3 direct uploads.

## Blockers

- None in code. Manual iMessage POC requires `imsg` installed and macOS permissions.

## Next steps

1. Run the manual iMessage POC (send a photo + command, confirm replies + try-on image).
2. Production hardening: replace local media with S3 + signed URLs; upgrade strict validator to a landmark model.
